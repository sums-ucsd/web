# Past Talks
A lightning talk is a short presentation meant to quickly introduce a topic or concept to an audience.
At SUMS, we host lightning talks related to mathematics and related fields and industries.
In other words, if your talk is marginally related to math, we'd love to host your talk!

SUMS lightning talks typically last anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour.
Anyone can give a lightning talk, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff.
Attendance is open to the public.
